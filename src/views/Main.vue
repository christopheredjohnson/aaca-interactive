        <h1>the aaca national awards</h1>

        <div>
            <p>The AACA has established a comprehensive awards program to recognize outstanding achievement, superior contribution to the AACA and the hobby, participation in special events and restoration excellence. The program includes three categories of awards:</p>
            <p>National Awards, National Meet Competition Awards, and Region/Chapter Newsletter Contest Awards.</p>
            <p>National Awards are presented to selected recipients based on criteria established by the Board of Directors. The awards are divided into two general groups. Some are presented for outstanding vehicles entered in AACA National Activities and others are presented for specific achievements of individuals or organizations. The trophies for these awards have been donated to the AACA and many of them memorialize specific individuals for their contribution to the automotive industry or to the Antique Automobile hobby. The original trophies are displayed at the AACA National Headquarters and recipients receive an engraved crystal award commemorating the award during the Awards Banquet at the AACA Annual Meeting.</p>
